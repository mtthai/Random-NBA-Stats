*Cannot use api server on any PAAS ilke Heroku because <a href="https://github.com/bttmly/nba/issues/41"> stats.nba blocks all calls from those services. </a> But it works locally.

2. Install dependencies: npm install in root and client folder
3. Start api server: npm start or node index.js in root 
4. Start client: npm start in client folder
